							<h2>About</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As a data scientist with a background in economics and design, I am able to consider the broader context and implications of a project, identifying the important questions before narrowing down information towards an actionable solution. I strive to communicate my work through thoughtful and approachable methods, and to maintain a flexible approach to my workflow. As an analytical thinker, I enjoy the challenge of problem solving and look forward to strengthening my technical skills as I learn more and grow in the field of data science.

								<h3>Analyzing Neighborhood Characteristics of Affordable Housing Under 421a</h3>
								<p>The City of New York is facing a housing crisis that disproportionately affects those in the lowest income brackets. 421a is one of the largest affordable housing programs under the City's Housing New York initiative, which aims to provide an additional 300,000 affordable housing units by 2026. This project uses a gradient boosted model to analyze characteristics of neighborhoods where new developments are taking place, and looks to identify any factors that may predict whether or not a development will recive a tax abatement under 421a. These factors, if any, may indicate bias in the application of 421a and help to inform future iterations of the initiative.</p>

								<h3>Impact of Climate Change on Wine Production in California</h3>
								<p>The agricultural industry in California is vulnerable to climate change, with significant economic implications for crop production in the years to come. The wine and winegrape sector alone employs 325,000 people and generates upwards of 50 billion dollars in annual economic activity. This project considers wine grape production, as measured by yield per acre, in the top wine producing counties in California and monthly weather indicators, using a linear regression model to analyze the sensitivity of production to year to year fluctuations in weather. This analysis is then used to map production in response to select climate prediction models, to attempt to predict the level of wine production under each scenario.  </p>

								<h3>Comparing Language Between Renewable Energy and Energy Subreddits</h3>
								<p>Faced with a rapidly changing climate and declining fossil fuel reserves, the shift from traditional fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy (including wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and bioenergy) becomes increasingly important year to year. The language surrounding this shift, as observed in subreddits r/RenewableEnergy and r/Energy, is reflective of its complex nature. The following analysis of the each subreddit and the comparison between the two subreddits aims to provide insights on the current language and public sentiment surrounding and identifying linguistic overlap and differences. This analysis may be used to help inform language or strategies to be used towards bridging the two subjects and ultimately strengthening support for Renewable Energy.</p>
